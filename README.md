# Student-Score-Analyzer
Created by Amine Mustapha

This is a simple Python mini-project that analyzes students’ scores.
It lets the user enter each student’s name and score, then calculates:

 Total number of students

 Class average

 Highest and lowest score (with student names)

 Each student’s grade (A, B, C, F)
